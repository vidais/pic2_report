\noindent Computer Architecture is one of the key knowledge areas in Computer Engineering, with courses being
regular subjects within the curricula. Educators often aim to teach not only the theoretical concepts but
also their practical applications. These pratical tasks are mostly done within a laboratory using simulators
of the computer systems being teached. The organization of such a course requires decisions to be made
regarding the topics to be covered, practical exercises and laboratory work. The choice of which simulator
to use or if a new one should be developed is an important one, as it defines the base on which most
laboratory work must be built upon.\\
Ripes is a visual computer architecture simulator and assembly code editor built for the Reduced Instruction 
Set Computer V (RISC-V) Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It explores proemininent computer
architecture concepts such as machine code execution, its’ compilation, assembly and interaction with
memory-mapped Input/Output (IO) devices.\\
In spite of its usefulness in assisting teachers and students, Ripes lacks support for native execution
of Floating Point (FP) intructions. Extending the simulator in this direction enables students to visualize
FP pipelines, separate register files for FP and how Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
754-compliant rounding modes impact program execution.
